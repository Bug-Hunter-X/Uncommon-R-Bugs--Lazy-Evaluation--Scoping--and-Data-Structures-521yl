This repository demonstrates some less common bugs in R programming that can be tricky to debug. The examples highlight issues related to R's lazy evaluation, scoping rules, and the way data structures behave when modified.  The `bug.R` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.R` provides explanations and corrected versions.  This is particularly useful for intermediate to advanced R users who are familiar with the basics but want to understand these edge cases.
